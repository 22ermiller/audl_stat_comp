Creation process: I first started by inserting all the figures I made in the EDA into the app. And then I added filters the user could adjust such as a year selector and a team selector.
The hardest part was getting the app formatted in a visually appealing way. At first everything is put in 1 row with pretty large margins. I had to learn how to use columns as containers to fit
everything in a neater way. It was also a struggle trying to know how much to guide the user of the app vs just letting them explore on their own.

Feedback:
1. Make recommendations on which teams to explore for users who don't know much about the AUDL
2. For the 2nd part of the app, put separate lines for each team so metrics can be compared not only year over year but also team by team.
3. Change colors to be more visually appealing. 

Adjustments made:
There were some typos that I had to fix, and I also added some more direction for the user just because not very many people are familiar with the AUDL. I also used the suggestion to separate lines in
2nd part of the app which added a much more interesting element to the app. I set the color pallette to Set2 as well and it softened things up a bit.
