Feedback Received:
1. Include questions to ask when exploring random metrics in the 2nd part of the post to help walk readers through the EDA a little better.
2. Adjust the banner header to the post
3. The title of a graph is getting cutoff, so make sure it's all visible
4. Do a better job of explaining how metrics translate to onfield play. 

Adjustments made:
I chose a different image for the banner that would be more visually appealing for readers. I also added questions to think about before the 2nd part of the post. This would hopefully direct readers' minds a little better. I also made sure all graphics were fully visible.
