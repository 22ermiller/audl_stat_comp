## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore basic performance trends over the last decade in the AUDL (American Ulimate Disc League). The AUDL is a relatively young professional ultimate frisbee league. It was founded in 2010 and so there have been about 12 full seasons. Because the league is so young, one would expect to see substantial developments in not only the strategy of the game, but in overall performance. In this project I will explore this idea by comparing league and player statistics across different seasons/years. Doing this we can answer questions such as, "Has the overall quality of the sport increased over the years? If so, by how much?", "What metrics/statistics have changed the most?", "What years did the league see the most growth in player performance?", etc. The nature of the project is not to draw conclusions from statistical models but to perform simple EDA and report findings through visualization.

## Repository Contents

In this repository you can find all code used to gather, explore, and visualize the data obtained from the AUDL API. There also is a feedback folder that contains feedback received from classmates about project ideas and project content critiques (this project is completed in a classroom setting).
